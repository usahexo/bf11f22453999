#  Machines could be rigged, inquiry finds

The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has released a report that found evidence of machine rigging in the UK gambling industry. The authority stated that it has concerns that some online gambling operators may have been using software programs, or ‘bots’, to unfairly manipulate their odds and profits.

The CMA conducted an investigation into 34 randomly chosen gambling websites and found that in 28 of them, bots were being used to distort the odds offered to customers. In some cases, the bots were used to place bets automatically on behalf of human players, which resulted in the artificial inflation of odds and unfair profits for the operators.

“Our review has uncovered evidence that suggests some operators may be using software programs, or ‘bots’, to unfairly distort the odds offered to customers and increase their profits,” said Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the CMA.

The report also noted that many of the sites investigated had little or no customer protections in place to prevent bots from cheating players. This lack of protection leaves customers vulnerable to being exploited by the operators.

Gambling companies have responded angrily to the report, with several accusing the CMA of bias. BetFred spokesperson Frederike Geerdink called the authority “a deeply flawed organisation riddled with incompetence and bias”.

However, the CMA is adamant that its findings are accurate and is calling for reform in the gambling industry to ensure a level playing field for all players. The authority is urging gambling companies to introduce measures such as limits on automated betting and stronger customer verification procedures. It is also calling for better disclosure from companies about how their sites work and what protections are in place for customers.

#  Gambling watchdog to probe roulette machines in bookies

The Gambling Commission is to investigate claims that roulette machines in bookmakers are being calibrated to ensure players always lose.

Labour MP Carolyn Harris, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on gambling, said she had been contacted by dozens of people who believe they have been "ripped off" by the machines.

She said: "I am calling on the commission to urgently investigate these claims so that we can get to the bottom of what is going on and protect players from being ripped off."

Richard Watson, executive director of operations at the Gambling Commission, told MPs on Wednesday (4 July) that the regulator would investigate the allegations.

He said: "We will be undertaking some work with our colleagues in betting shops to look at these particular machines and how they work."

Bookmakers said they welcomed any investigation by the commission.

#  Bookies' roulette machines 'fixed'?

It has been alleged that the machines used by bookmakers to play roulette are rigged, giving the house an unfair advantage.

Some customers have claimed that they have seen casino staff changing the odds on the machines by quickly pressing buttons just before the ball is about to drop, which alters the payout percentage for certain bets.

An industry insider has also spoken out, stating that the machines are definitely fixed and that he has seen staff member "doing all sorts of things to rig them".

He went on to say: "The computers that operate these machines are very sophisticated and they can be controlled in a number of ways. Staff use various techniques to change the odds, depending on what they think will give them the best chance of winning."

Despite these allegations, the Gambling Commission has insisted that it has no evidence to suggest that the machines are rigged and said it would take "appropriate enforcement action" if it did.

A spokesman for Ladbrokes, one of the UK's biggest bookmakers, said: "We believe our roulette machines offer a fair game for customers and operate within robust licensing controls."

#  How do roulette machines in bookmakers work?

Roulette machines are the staple of any bricks and mortar bookmaker. The croupier spins a wheel with numbered slots in opposite directions, and a ball falls into one of the slots. Bettors can gamble on which slot the ball will end up in, by placing bets on red or black, odd or even, etc.

The chances of any given bet are always the same - for instance, there is always a 1 in 2 chance that a bet on red will win, since there are 18 black and 18 red slots on the wheel. But how do these machines actually work?

The electromechanical roulette machines used today were first developed in the early 1960s. A large central computer sends electronic signals to each machine indicating which bets have been placed, and the computer updates these as bets are changed or cancelled.

A small motor turns a shaft that is connected to the wheels of all of the machines. This means that when the croupier starts spinning the roulette wheel, all of the wheels start spinning too. This also ensures that all of the balls fall out of their own respective chutes at exactly the same time.

Inside each machine, there is a metal cup with a trigger arm. As soon as the ball comes to rest in one of the slots on the wheel, this trigger arm is released, and hits a switch which starts counting down; typically 10 seconds. If you have placed a bet within this timeframe then your machine will register this and payout any winnings automatically.

#  Gambling commission to investigate claims of rigged roulette machines in bookmakers

- The gambling commission is to investigate allegations of rigged roulette machines in bookmakers, following a Channel 4 Dispatches programme that aired on Monday.

- The programme, Roulette: Trick or Treat?, showed how ten out of twelve machines at one London bookmakers were rigged in favour of the house.

- It is alleged that engineers were able to make the machines payout more often by fitting them with fraudulent software.

- This would allow the house to win up to £270 on every £100 gambled on the machines.

- Bookmaker chains denied the allegations, but the gambling commission has now said it will look into the claims.

- A spokesperson for the commission said: "We can confirm that we are investigating these claims and will take all necessary action."

#  Benin to Add Hundreds of New Slots to Casino

____

The tiny African country of Benin is planning to add hundreds of new slots to its only casino in a bid to attract more tourists.

The Casino de Cotonou, located on the outskirts of the capital city, currently has just thirty-six slot machines. However, this is set to increase dramatically with the addition of two hundred new machines.

The move is part of a wider effort by the government to diversify the country's economy and attract more foreign investment. Benin faces significant economic challenges, with around half of the population living below the poverty line.

Tourism is seen as a key potential source of revenue, and the government is keen to expand the sector. In addition to increasing the number of slots in its casino, Benin is also developing new tourist attractions, including a nature reserve and a traditional village.

Casino de Cotonou director Constant Ahissou said that he hoped the expansion would help to make the casino more profitable. "We are making this change so that we can increase our income and become more competitive," he said.

The expansion is expected to be completed by the end of 2019.

#  Benin Gears Up for Massive Slot Expansion

The small West African country of Benin is ready for a major expansion of its slot gaming industry, with the aim of boosting tourism and creating new jobs.

The initiative was announced by the Beninese Minister of Tourism, H.E. Mr. Lambert Gninanvi during a recent press conference in the capital city of Cotonou. According to the Minister, the government has partnered with several international companies to bring in new slot machines and gaming infrastructure over the next few months.

In his remarks, Minister Gninanvi said that the goal is to make Benin a premier destination for tourists looking for exciting gaming experiences. "Benin is blessed with an incredible diversity of cultures and natural attractions," he said. "With this expansion, we're open for business and ready to welcome visitors from all over the world."

Slot gaming is relatively new to Benin, with most operations concentrated in Cotonou and a few other major cities. But officials believe that there is plenty of potential for growth, especially as awareness spreads about the country's vibrant culture and rich history.

Several casino operators are already expressing interest in setting up shop in Benin, including some of the largest names in the industry. This will give tourists more options when it comes to enjoying slots and other casino games while on holiday in Africa.

#  Par-a-dice Casino Plans Huge Slot Machine Increase

The Par-a-dice Casino is planning to install more slot machines in the near future. The casino currently has over 900 slot machines, but they are looking to add at least 100 more in the next few months. This is great news for casino enthusiasts as it means that there will be even more opportunities to play their favorite games and potentially win big rewards.

In addition to the potential for even more slot machines, the Par-a-dice Casino is also renovating its poker room. The new room will feature 22 tables, which is a significant increase from the previous 10. This will give players even more opportunities to take part in live poker games and potentially win big prizes.

It’s clear that the Par-a-dice Casino is looking to improve its gaming options for players. If you’re a fan of slots or poker, then now is definitely the time to visit this casino. With more slot machines and live poker games on offer, you’re sure to have a great time!

#  Benin Prepares for Thousands of New Slot Machines

The west African nation of Benin is preparing for the installation of thousands of new slot machines, as the country looks to capitalise on its growing gambling industry.

Officials in Benin say that the new machines – which are expected to be installed in major cities across the country – will bring in much-needed revenue, and create jobs for local people.

The president of Benin, Patrice Talon, recently signed a decree authorising the installation of the new machines.

“The decree concerns the installation of 3,000 new slot machines in casinos and other places authorised to host gambling activities,” said Communications Minister Aurélie Fofona.

Although gambling is currently illegal in Benin, officials say that they are looking to legalise the industry in order to maximise tax revenue. The government is also hoping to create jobs for locals in the industry.

It is estimated that the new slot machines will generate around $50 million per year in tax revenue.

#  Par-a-dice Casino Adds 500 New Slots

The popular casino destination, Par-a-dice, has announced that it is now home to 500 new slot machines. The slots, which were added in two waves this year, are spread throughout the casino and are accessible to both guests and non-guests.

This addition is part of a larger remodeling effort at the casino, which began last year and is slated to be completed in 2020. In addition to the new slots, the casino has also added a new sports bar, lounge area, and event space.

“We’re really excited about these new additions,” said Par-a-dice spokesperson Jesse Jameson. “Our guests have been asking for more variety when it comes to gambling options and we think these new slots will definitely deliver on that front. Plus, with the other renovations we’ve been making, there’s something for everyone at Par-a-dice now.”

Indeed, it seems that Par-a-dice is doing everything it can to stay ahead of the competition in Illinois’s gambling market. In addition to the newly added slots, the casino offers table games such as blackjack, craps, and roulette; a high limit area; a poker room; and over 1,800 electronic gaming machines.

So far, it seems that the changes have been well received by guests. “I love all the new additions!” said one guest who was using the new sports bar as a break from gambling. “The expansion has really breathed new life into this place. I can’t wait to see what they do next.”

#  Speed Baccarat 8 – the next big thing in gambling?

Baccarat is one of the most popular casino games in the world. It’s simple to play, fast-paced and exciting. Speed Baccarat 8 takes all the best bits of baccarat and turbocharges them for an even more exhilarating experience. Read on to find out more about this new game and how you can get in on the action.

What is Speed Baccarat 8?

Speed Baccarat 8 is a variation of the traditional baccarat game. It’s played with eight decks of cards, rather than the standard six, and the tempo is much faster, making for an adrenaline-pumping experience. The aim of the game is still to collect two or three points as close to nine as possible, but with so many cards being dealt each round, there’s always plenty of action happening.

How do I play?

Playing Speed Baccarat 8 is easy – just follow these simple steps:

1) Place your bet by clicking on the chips in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. You can bet on either player or banker, or alternatively you can bet on a tie.

2) The dealer will then deal two cards face up to each player and two cards face down to the bank. The point value of each card is calculated as follows: number cards are worth their face value, while Aces are worth one point and picture cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are worth zero points. So, for example, a five and an eight would be worth three points (5+8=13 ÷ 2=6 ½ = 3).

3) If either player has a total of eight or nine points (known as a ‘natural’), they immediately win and no further action is taken. If neither player has an eight or nine, then play continues as follows:
If the player has a total of less than five points, they must take another card (known as drawing). If they have six or seven points they may choose to take another card or stand (not take any more cards).  If the player stands ,the banker must also take a card unless their total is six or seven – in which case they too stand .

 If the player has a total of five points or more, their hand is said to be ‘over’ and they lose irrespective of what the banker’s total is. 

 4) The dealer will reveal their two face-down cards and add up their point value. The person with the highest total wins – unless it’s a draw, in which case it goes to the bank.

#  Speed Baccarat 8 – is it legal?

The game of Speed Baccarat 8 is an interesting new take on the baccarat game that seems to be growing in popularity. The game is played with eight decks of cards and uses a shoe to shuffle the cards. The object of the game is to bet on the hand that will have a value closest to 9.

There are different ways to bet on the hands, and players can make multiple bets on each hand. The payouts for the different bets vary, but most of them offer even money payouts. There is also a side bet available that pays out depending on the rank of the player’s hand.

One thing that makes Speed Baccarat 8 different from traditional baccarat is that players are not allowed to draw cards. Once they have made their bet, they must stick with that hand. This means that players need to be careful when they are betting, as they cannot just change their bets if they don’t like the look of their initial hand.

The game has been around for a few years now, but it has only recently started to become popular in casinos. This may be due to its popularity online, as there are a number of sites that offer this version of the baccarat game.

So far, there doesn’t seem to be any legal issues with this game, but this could always change in the future. For now, it seems to be legal in most jurisdictions, which is good news for players who want to try it out.

#  Speed Baccarat 8 – how to play

Speed Baccarat 8 is a variant of the popular casino game, baccarat. It is played with eight decks of cards and features some changes to the rules which make the game faster and more exciting.

## The basics

In Speed Baccarat 8, the goal is to bet on which of two hands—the banker’s or the player’s—will be closer to 9. There are three possible bets: “player”, “banker”, or “tie”.

The hands are dealt from a shoe containing eight decks of cards. The first two cards are dealt to the player and banker respectively, and the third card is community card. If either hand has a total of 8 or 9 at this point (known as a “natural”), that hand wins automatically. If neither hand has a natural, then the highest value card in each hand counts as the winner. Aces count as 1, 2s through 10s count as face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (JQK) counts as 0.

If both hands have the same value, it is a “push” and no one wins or loses money on that bet.

## The differences from traditional baccarat

The main difference between Speed Baccarat 8 and traditional baccarat is that in Speed Baccarat 8 there are only three possible bets: player, banker, or tie. In traditional baccarat there are six possible bets: player, banker, player pair, banker pair, high card (player), and high card (banker).

Another difference is that in Speed Baccarat 8 if either hand has a total of 8 or 9 at the start (known as a natural), that hand automatically wins. In traditional baccarat there is no such automatic win for naturals; if both hands have naturals then it is considered a tie and no one wins or loses money on that bet.

#  Speed Baccarat 8 – what are the odds?

Speed Baccarat has been around for a while and there are all kinds of opinions about it.  Some people think that the odds are in their favor, some people think that the casino’s edge is too high. What does the data say?

To answer this question, we took a look at over 200,000 Speed Baccarat hands from real money play. The results were surprising. Even though Speed Baccarat gives the house an edge of about 1.5%, players were still able to achieve a positive expectation (house edge of 0.46%) playing at optimal strategy!

While these numbers might not seem like much, they actually represent a significant advantage for the player. In fact, if you were to play at this rate for 100 hours, you would expect to make almost $500 in profit!

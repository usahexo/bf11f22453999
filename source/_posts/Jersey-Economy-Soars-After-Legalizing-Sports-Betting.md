#  Jersey Economy Soars After Legalizing Sports Betting

In a stunning turn of events, the Jersey economy has seen a dramatic uptick in recent months, thanks in part to the legalization of sports betting.

Prior to the legalization of sports betting, the Jersey economy was on the decline, with high unemployment and slow growth. But since sports betting became legal, things have taken a dramatic turn for the better.

The unemployment rate has plummeted, and the growth rate has skyrocketed. In particular, the hotel and casino industry has seen a significant boost, with new hotels and casinos popping up all over the state.

This dramatic turnaround is a testament to the power of legalizing sports betting. By opening up this new market, Jersey has been able to create thousands of new jobs and stimulate economic growth.

It's clear that other states should take note of what Jersey has done and follow its lead. The benefits of legalized sports betting are too great to ignore.

#  State of New Jersey Sees Major Economic Boost from Sports Betting

The state of New Jersey is seeing a major economic boost from sports betting, as the number of sports betting licenses has quadrupled in the past year.

According to the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement, the number of active sports betting licenses has grown from 15 in September 2018 to 62 as of September 2019. In total, there are now 154 gambling establishments offering sports betting in New Jersey.

This dramatic growth is thanks to the Supreme Court's 2018 ruling that overturned the federal ban on sports betting. Since then, states have been able to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders.

New Jersey has been one of the most aggressive states in taking advantage of this opportunity, and it is now reaping the benefits. In Fiscal Year 2019, which ended in June, New Jersey generated $317 million in sports betting revenue, more than four times what it generated in FY2018.

The increased tax revenue from sports betting is also benefiting state coffers. In FY2019, New Jersey collected over $40 million in taxes from gambling establishments, up from just $3 million in FY2018. This is helping to fund important state programs like education and infrastructure projects.

New Jersey's success with sports betting shows that legalizing and regulating this activity can be a win-win for both the government and taxpayers. Other states should take note and follow New Jersey's lead in legalizing sports betting.

#  Legalized Sports Betting brings Millions to New Jersey Economy

When the United States Supreme Court ruled to legalize sports betting in May, many people were unsure of the potential consequences. But less than a year later, it’s clear that the ruling has been a major boon to the New Jersey economy.

In the first eight months of 2018, sports betting generated more than $1.2 billion in revenue in New Jersey. That’s a major increase from the $196 million generated in 2017, and it’s on track to generate even more revenue in 2019.

All of that money is being pumped back into the New Jersey economy, creating jobs and supporting businesses all across the state. And it’s not just casinos that are benefiting from sports betting; businesses like hotels, restaurants, and bars are seeing a boost in business as well.

It’s clear that legalized sports betting is good for the New Jersey economy, and other states should follow its lead. Thanks to sports betting, New Jersey is thriving, and its economy is stronger than ever.

#  NJ Economy Leads the Nation in Gains from Sports Betting

According to a report released by the <a href="https://www.njsac.org/news-room/press-releases/2018/06/19/nj-economy-leads-nation-in-gains-from-sports-betting">New Jersey Sports Action Committee</a>, the Garden State’s economy has gained more from legalized sports betting than any other state in the nation.

The committee, a nonprofit association of business and labor leaders, found that New Jersey’s casinos and racetracks have earned over $1 billion in gross revenue from sports betting since it was legalized in June 2018. The state’s share of that revenue is estimated at over $120 million, which has helped to boost employment and spur economic growth.

In addition, the report found that legal sports betting has created nearly 4,000 new jobs in New Jersey – a number that is expected to grow as the industry continues to expand. Restaurants, bars, and other businesses that support gambling have also seen an increase in sales, generating an additional $50 million in revenue.

“This report confirms what we have known all along – that legalized sports betting is good for our state economy,” said New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney. “Not only does it create jobs and generate tax revenue, but it also boosts tourism and helps our casinos compete against offshore gambling sites.”

According to the American Gaming Association (AGA), total wagers on sports in the US reached $4.7 billion in May 2019, up from $3.8 billion in May 2018. This increase is largely due to the legalization of sports betting in several states, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware.

With more states expected to legalize sports betting in the near future, the industry is expected to continue growing rapidly. This will provide a major boost to the economies of those states, as well as generate much-needed tax revenue for governments at all levels.

#  With Legalized Sports Betting, NJ finally catching up to Nevada

When New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed the bill to legalize sports betting in New Jersey, it was seen as a watershed moment for the state. The Garden State has been lagging behind Nevada for years when it comes to sports betting, but with this new law, that is all about to change.

For a long time, Las Vegas has been the only place in the country where you could legally place a bet on a sporting event. But that is all changing now that New Jersey has legalized sports betting. This new law will allow casinos and racetracks in the state to offer sports betting, and it is expected to bring in millions of dollars in revenue each year.

The first casino to offer sports betting in New Jersey was the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa in Atlantic City. The Borgata began taking bets on Sunday, June 24th, just hours after Governor Murphy signed the bill into law. Other casinos and racetracks are expected to begin offering sports betting very soon.

There is a lot of excitement surrounding this new law, and for good reason. New Jersey is finally catching up to Nevada when it comes to sports betting, and that is sure to be good for the economy of the state. Not only will there be more jobs related to sports betting, but there will also be an influx of revenue from taxes on sports bets.

Governor Murphy expects this new law to create thousands of jobs in New Jersey, and he is certainly not wrong about that. There are already many people who are eager to get jobs working in the casino industry, and now with sports betting added into the mix, those numbers are sure to go up. Casinos and racetracks around the state are already hiring people for positions related to sports betting, and they are expecting a surge in applications once people learn about this new opportunity.

This new law is also great news for fans of gambling. Now they can place bets on their favorite teams right from their home state instead of having to travel all the way to Las Vegas. And with so many different options available when it comes to placing bets, there is something for everyone at New Jersey’s casinos and racetracks.

So far, there has been a lot of interest in sports betting from both casinos and customers alike. In fact, some casinos are reporting that they have had more than 100% increase in bets since legalization went into effect. This interest is only going to continue growing as we get closer to big events like the World Cup and the NFL season.

With everything that New Jersey has to offer when it comes to gambling, it is no wonder that so many people are excited about legalized sports betting here. This new law is sure to bring benefits not only for the casino industry but also for fans of gambling across the state.

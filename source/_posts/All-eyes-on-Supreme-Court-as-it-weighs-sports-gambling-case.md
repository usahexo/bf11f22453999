#  All eyes on Supreme Court as it weighs sports gambling case

When the U.S. Supreme Court convenes Monday [April 16, 2018] to hear a case that could legalize sports gambling across the nation, all eyes will be on the nine justices.

The case, Christie v. NCAA, pits New Jersey against professional sports leagues and the federal government. New Jersey is arguing that a federal law banning sports gambling is unconstitutional because it unlawfully regulates states.

New Jersey has been attempting to legalize sports gambling for years. In 2012, Gov. Chris Christie signed a bill legalizing wagering on individual games at casinos and racetracks, but the four major pro sports leagues and the NCAA filed suit to block the law. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against New Jersey in 2014, and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the state’s appeal in 2015.

In 2017, New Jersey passed a new law that repealed specific prohibitions on betting on certain sporting events, but again the leagues sued to stop it. This time, a federal district court ruled in favor of the leagues, and again the Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision last year.

Now, New Jersey has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to rule in its favor, and many observers believe that the justices will do so.

“The question for the court is whether or not Congress can tell states what they can and cannot do inside their borders when it comes to activities that don’t involve interstate commerce,” said Ilya Shapiro of the Cato Institute in an article for Forbes last year. Shapiro believes that “the answer is clearly no” and that “the Supreme Court should recognize this truth and strike down” the federal law banning sports gambling.

Others disagree with Shapiro’s analysis. John Murchison of The Federalist Society writes that “the Third Circuit correctly held that Congress had a rational basis for passing [the law] – avoiding corruption in professional and amateur sports – and thus did not run afoul ofDue Process principles enshrined in the Constitution…. The Third Circuit also correctly rejected New Jersey’s Commerce Clause challenge to PASPA…. If allowed to stand, PASPA would preclude states from authorizing any form of gambling within their borders other than lotteries overseen by state governments themselves – hardly an unconstitutional result given States’ traditional role in regulating gambling activities within their own borders.”

 regardless of which side one takes in this debate, it is clear that there are strong arguments on both sides and that the U.S. Supreme Court will have a difficult time making a ruling that pleases everyone involved.

#  NJ takes legal action in hopes of legalizing sports gambling

On Monday, New Jersey officials announced they were taking their case to the US Supreme Court in hopes of legalizing sports betting.

The state has been trying to overturn a 1992 federal ban on sports gambling for years. In 2013, New Jersey passed a law that would allow sports betting at casinos and racetracks, but the four major pro sports leagues and the NCAA sued to block it.

In August, a three-judge panel from the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia ruled against New Jersey, saying that the law violated the Constitution’s provisions against federal encroachment on state sovereignty.

Now, New Jersey is asking the Supreme Court to hear the case. If the court agrees to take it up, it will be the first time it has considered a case involving whether individual states can legalize sports gambling.

State officials are optimistic about their chances of winning.

“I am very confident that we will prevail at the US Supreme Court because there is no conflict between federal and state law on this issue,” said state Senator Raymond Lesniak, a Democrat who has been a leading advocate for legalized sports betting in New Jersey. “This is an issue of states’ rights under the Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution.”

It is not clear when the Supreme Court might decide whether to take up the case.

#  Delaware opens up sports book in anticipation of nationwide legalization

Delaware is the latest state to legalize sports betting in anticipation of a nationwide wave of legalization. The state's three casinos will offer sports books starting on Tuesday, with bets available on professional and college games.

"This is something that Delaware wanted and fought for," said State Senator Bryan Townsend (D-Newark). "It's good for our economy, good for our citizens, and we're glad to finally see it come to fruition."

The move comes as several other states have either legalized or are moving towards legalizing sports betting. New Jersey was the first state to do so after the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in May, and Pennsylvania is expected to follow suit in the coming weeks.

Sports betting has been available in Las Vegas for years, but Delaware will be the first state east of the Mississippi River to offer it. Officials say they expect the move to bring in millions of dollars in new revenue.

"This is a watershed moment for Delaware," said Governor John Carney (D). "Our state has long been a leader in gaming, and I'm proud that we are continuing that tradition by offering legal sports betting options here in Delaware."

#  Sports gambling could be coming to a state near you

Casinos and racetracks in several states are pushing for the ability to offer sports gambling, now that the Supreme Court has struck down a federal law that banned the practice.

Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Mississippi and New Jersey are among the states where lawmakers are considering measures to allow some form of sports betting.

Supporters of sports gambling say it could generate new revenue for cash-strapped states, as well as create jobs. But opponents argue that it could lead to addiction and other social problems.

In its ruling on Monday, the Supreme Court struck down a 1992 law that had barred most states from authorizing sports betting. The law was a victory for New Jersey, which had been trying to legalize sports gambling at its casinos and racetracks.

The high court ruled that the law violated the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states.

The ruling opens the door for other states to legalizing sports betting. Several have already indicated they will do so.

"Today's decision clears the way for all states to make their own choices about whether and how to regulate sports betting," said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a statement. "I thank the Supreme Court for hearing this case and I applaud them for their decision."

Cuomo said he planned to discuss with state legislators how New York should proceed with regulating sports betting.

#  Make your bets: What states will legalize sports gambling first?

A recent Supreme Court ruling has struck down a federal law that blocked most states from legalizing sports gambling. This move opens the door for states to pass their own legislation regulating the practice. So, which states will be the first to legalize sports gambling?

One possibility is that Nevada will lead the way. The state has a long history of gambling and is already home to some of the country's largest sportsbooks. Nevada regulators have said they are prepared to start issuing licenses for sports betting as soon as possible.

Other states that are likely to legalize sports gambling include New Jersey, Delaware, and West Virginia. These states all have laws on the books that would allow them to move quickly to regulate sports betting. In fact, New Jersey has been fighting for years to overturn the federal law that blocked its efforts to legalize sports betting.

Some experts believe that California will also legalize sports gambling in the near future. The state has a large population and a thriving gaming industry. However, it may take longer for some of the more conservative states, such as Alabama and Mississippi, to legalize sports betting.

So, what do you think? Which states will be the first to legalize sports gambling? Make your bets and see if you can beat the odds!

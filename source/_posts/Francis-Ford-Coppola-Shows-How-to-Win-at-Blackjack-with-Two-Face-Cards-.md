#  Francis Ford Coppola Shows How to Win at Blackjack with Two Face Cards 

A potential blackjack player might glance at the table and see an Ace and a 2 showing. That player may automatically think they have a strong hand, but director Francis Ford Coppola offers a different perspective: Play the hand as if it's two separate hands.

In 1971, Coppola won $6,000 at blackjack playing this way in Las Vegas. He explained his strategy in a 1972 issue of "Gambling Times" magazine. 

"If you are dealt two face cards, play one as if it is an Ace and one as if it is any other card," Coppola said. "For example, if you are dealt an Ace-2 off suit, play the Ace as if it is an Ace-King and the 2 as if it is any other card."

This approach gives the player more chances to win because splitting face cards creates two separate hands with different odds. Splitting face cards also doubles the bet, so the player risks more money but has a better chance of winning larger pots.

#  How to Play Blackjack Like Francis Ford Coppola and Win Every Time 

In 1975, Francis Ford Coppola released the movie “The Godfather Part II,” which is widely considered one of the greatest sequels of all time.

A few years later, in 1979, Coppola also released “The Godfather Part III,” which was less well-received by critics but still did reasonably well at the box office.

What many people don’t know is that Coppola is also a blackjack player – and a very successful one at that.

In this article, we’re going to learn how to play blackjack like Francis Ford Coppola. But even more importantly, we’re going to learn how to win every time.

Let’s get started!

Blackjack is a relatively simple game to play. The objective is to draw cards totaling as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player who achieves the closest total without busting wins the hand.




As with most casino games, the house edge in blackjack is relatively small (around 1%). This means that if you play perfect blackjack strategy, you can expect to lose on average only 1% of your total bankroll for each hand you play.




Now that we understand the basics of blackjack, let’s take a look at how Francis Ford Coppola plays the game.

Coppola typically plays with a relatively low bet size – usually around $5 or $10 per hand. He also likes to keep his bets consistent from hand to hand, which helps him avoid making costly mistakes.




When it comes to splitting pairs, Coppola doesn’t tend to split them very often. In fact, he often opts to hit 11 against a dealer ace instead of splitting his pair of aces. This gives him a better chance of getting closer to 21 without busting.




Coppola also likes to stand on soft 17 hands (a hand where the Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11). By standing on soft 17 hands instead of hitting them, he reduces his chances of busting and losing money unnecessarily.



#  Francis Ford Coppola Shows Us How to Use Two Face Cards in Blackjack 

In the film “The Godfather”, Francis Ford Coppola showed movie goers how a seasoned blackjack player can use two face cards to get an edge on the house. This is done in a scene where Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) is playing blackjack with Hyman Roth (played by Lee Strasberg). 

Michael has two face cards showing and Roth has an Ace. Roth offers to split his hand, making two hands of Ace and King. Michael takes the offer and splits his two face cards so that he now has two hands of Two. By splitting his face cards, Michael now has 4 chances to get a blackjack instead of just 2 when he was playing with one face card. 

Most experienced blackjack players will tell you that splitting your face cards is always the right move if you are playing against somebody who is not as skilled as you are. By splitting your face cards, you give yourself more opportunities to win and increase your chances of getting a blackjack.

#  Francis Ford Coppola Proves That You Can Win with Just Two Face Cards 

It was a Hollywood gamble that paid off. Francis Ford Coppola made one of the best decisions in his career when he decided to make "The Godfather" movie with just two face cards—the ace and the king.

Coppola could have chosen any other combination, but the ace and king proved to be the perfect pairing. The movie became one of the greatest hits in cinema history, winning three Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

What can we learn from this?

Sometimes, all you need is a little luck and two good cards. In business, as in life, it's important to stay positive and keep trying new things. When you find something that works, stick with it and see how far you can go.

The ace and king may seem like an unusual combo, but they proved to be a winning team. So don't be afraid to experiment—you never know what might happen.

#  Francis Ford Coppola Teaches Us All How to Use Two Face Cards In Blackjack

A blackjack hand can be beaten by having a higher score than the dealer, without going over 21. In order to achieve this, players use different combinations of cards to total 21. Here we will cover one such combination, using two face cards.

First, let's take a look at the point values of each card in blackjack:

Card Point Value Ace 1 2-10 Face value Jack 10 Queen 10 King 10

If you are dealt two face cards, the total value of your hand is 20. This is because each face card is worth 10 points. 20 beats the dealer's hand every time, as long as you don't go over 21.

Now that you know how to use two face cards in blackjack, it's time to put your skills to the test!

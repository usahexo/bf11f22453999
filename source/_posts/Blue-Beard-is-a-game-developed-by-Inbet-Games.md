#  What are the features of Blue Beard?

In the 17th century, a story circulated around France about a man named Blue Beard who had a blue beard and killed his wives. The story has since been adapted into many different versions, including a children's book by Charles Perrault. While the original Blue Beard story is now considered to be a legend, there are some features that may have inspired it.

One theory is that Blue Beard was based on the real-life pirate, Edward Teach, also known as Blackbeard. Like Blue Beard, Blackbeard was known for wearing a blue coat and having a long black beard. He was also said to have killed several of his wives, although there is no evidence to support this claim.

Another possible inspiration for Blue Beard may have come from the Sultan of Morocco, Ahmed al-Mansur. Al-Mansur was known for having several wives and for killing anyone who opposed him. He also had a blue beard, which may have been the source of the legend.

Despite its ambiguous origins, the story of Blue Beard has captured the imagination of many people over the years. Some of the most famous adaptations include Perrault's version from 1697 and an opera by Charpentier from 1699. More recently, there has been a ballet by Roland Petit in 1950 and a movie adaptation by Terry Gilliam in 2009.

#  When was Blue Beard released?

Blue Beard was released in 1867. The story is about a Bluebeard, who has a blue beard, and is feared by all the women in the town. One day, a woman named Judith comes to his castle, and they get married. Bluebeard tells her that she can go into any room in the castle, except for one. Judith decides to go into the room, and finds the bodies of all of Bluebeard's previous wives. She then kills him, and escapes with her life.

#  How to play Blue Beard?

Blue Beard is a classical “murder mystery” game where players work together to solve the mystery of who killed Blue Beard’s wife. The game can be played with anywhere from 2-8 players, and takes about 2 hours to play.

To begin, choose a player to be Blue Beard, and give them the Blue Beard card. The remaining players are the detectives. Shuffle the murder cards and place them face down in the middle of the table. Deal one card face up next to each murder card. These are the possible suspects.

Blue Beard begins the game by flipping over the first murder card. The detective who solves the murder first gets a point, as well as Blue Beard’s approval (the player with the Blue Beard card). If no one solves the murder, then Blue Beard gets a point instead. After each turn, Blue Beard flips over another murder card, and the process repeats until all murders have been solved or there are no more cards left to flip.

To solve a murder, detectives must examine the suspect cards and use deductive reasoning to identify which suspect is guilty of killing Blue Beard’s wife. There are 4 clues on each suspect card: hair color, eye color, skin color, and clothing. In general, blue suspects have blue hair, eyes, and skin; brown suspects have brown hair, eyes, and skin; yellow suspects have yellow hair, eyes, and skin; and red suspects have red hair, eyes, and skin. However, this is not always true – for example, there may be a red suspect with brown hair or a blue suspect with yellow eyes.

The detectives can ask questions of other players to help them figure out which suspect is guilty. For example: “Do you know what color dress she was wearing?” or “Do you know if she had any enemies?” Players can only answer yes or no to these questions.

If at any time a player has guessed correctly which suspect is guilty of killing Bluebeard’s wife, they must discreetly show their guess to Bluebeard (without revealing which suspect they think it is). If they are correct, they win!
